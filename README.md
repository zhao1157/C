# C
## ========== 1. Learning_C/learning_c.c 
### My learning philosophy: 
1. Practice the syntax of the new language and test my understanding of it by putting it into various situations; 
2. Integrate what I have leant with the new piece I'm learning to improve my understanding and view of the new language; 
3. Compare with other languages I have learnt and try to solve some similar problems encountered before with the new language.

### My goals: 
1. Be familiar with and  master the new language; 
2. Through writing codes and testing of them, take good notes of the new language; 
3. Form my own syntax library of the new language for future review.

## ========== 2. Planck/dBdT.c 
This program is to calculate the first derivative of Planck function and generate its values at various positions for later plot.

## ========== 3. Add_Levels_454/{\*}
This code is the core part of obtaining the final FAC data for each transition. The other codes can be found in Bash/Add_Levels_454/.

***

## ========== 4. Combine_FAC_RM_454/{\*}
This code is the core part of adding FAC by RM to get the final photoionization cross section. The other codes are in 
Bash/Combine_FAC_RM_454.
